* snippets

a snippet is like a "repository lite".

a snippet allows for multiple files (but no subdirectory).

there's no git clone (or any kind of clone) for snippets.

there's no full acl for snippets, but a 5-tier system of visibility control exists:

+ public: anyone can see.
+ internal: anyone who logged in can see.
+ shared(link): anyone who has the link can see.
+ shared internal (link): anyone who logged in and has the link can see.
+ shared(user): anyone who's been explicitly selected by the owner can see.
+ private: only the owner can see.
