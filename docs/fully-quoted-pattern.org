* fully-quoted pattern

A way to store multiple tags as a single string.

If you store tags separated w/ comma and search by simple patterns like LIKE ='%some-tag%'=, you'll match tags w/ the same string as prefix or suffix.

A way solve this is to quote every tag with braces and perform the following change:

+ Instead of storing as =a1,a2,...,an=, store as ={a1}{a2}{...}{an}=.
+ Instead of searching w/ =LIKE '%some-tag%'=, search w/ =LIKE '%{some-tag}%'=.
+ When unmarshalling, instead of splitting by comma, remove the first and the last character and split by =}{=.
