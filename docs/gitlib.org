* gitlib

** on using w/ path that does not have a git folder

note that currently =gitlib.NewLocalGitRepository= would initialize a bare git repo if the provided directory does not exist / is not a git folder.

** on getting the last commit that modifies a file

=git rev-list -1 HEAD -- [filepath]= returns the commit id. for other commits, replace HEAD with commit id.
