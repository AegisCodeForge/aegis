* single file update

currently aegis uses git-fast-import. the process consists of two commands:

+ =git fast-import --date-format=now --quiet=
  + we send the payload to its stdin.
  + we read the content of its stdout.
+ =git update-ref [ref-full-name] [commit-id]=
  + =[ref-full-name]= are the ones that starts with =refs/heads/=, like =refs/heads/master=.
  + =[commit-id]= comes from the stdout from the first command.

** how =git-fast-import= is used

#+begin_src
commit [ref-full-name]
mark :1
author [user-full-name] <[user-email]> now
committer [user-full-name] <[user-email> now
data <<%
[commit message]
%
from [ref-full-name]^0
M [mode] inline [path]
data <<%
data
%

get-mark :1
#+end_src

according to [[https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fast-import][git-fast-import's documentation]]:

+ the =commit= line specifies the branch the new commit needs to be made on.
+ =mark= marks the commit. we need to add a mark here so we can retrieve the id of new commit with =get-mark= command at the last.
+ the next 3 command is for specifying the author, the committer and the commit message.
  + if you need to add a signature, you need to use the separate =gpgsig= command instead of appending the signature to the commit message, since unlike co-authored-by, gpg signature and commit messages are different slots in a commit object.
+ the =from= command is used to specify the parent commit of the created commit. use =[ref-full-name]^0= to specify the latest commit of the branch.
+ the line with =M= is a filemodify command that specifies the creation of a new file or a modification of an existing one.
  + if you use =inline= you need to use a =data= command to specify the data of the resulting file.
  + instead of using =inline= in the =M= command, one can first add the resulting file into the repository as a blob and do =M [mode] [blob-id] [path]= instead.

the =data= command has two forms which I will not describe here. currently aegis use the "delimited" form for commit message and "length-specified" form for text data, since delimited form cannot describe data that doesn't end with line feed.
